# oneacreproject

The **max_additions** folder in this repo attempts to address one of the limitations of the route optimization program/solver by splitting sites whose total weights (KGs) exceed a truck load capacity. Further development and adjustments would be required in coorperation with he Tech team in order to make this a fully funtional piece of software. Ideally the LP optimizer needs to be rewritten in order to address all other lingering issues such as cases where the solver doesn't return expected results. And my solution embedded to this program within the solver.

For contextual or further understanding of thes problems, please get in touch with Tobias Krause [tobias.krause@oneacrefund.org ]

Please switch to pyqt4branch, as it is more up to date since we found it easier to deploy.
